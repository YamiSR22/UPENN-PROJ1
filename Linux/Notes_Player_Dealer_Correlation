According to the information that was given and what was found during the investigation
while analyzing the data of each file, I found that the primary dealer that was working at 
the times where the most losses occured in March 10, 12, 15; was Evalyn Howell. And 
the primary player who had the most loss in those three days was Mylie Schmidt. Thus, because
of the amount of number these two individuals showed up during those three days, it was cleared
to me that the two where the main targets working together, to scam the Lucky Duck Casino based
on sufficient evidence that I found.
